  summary: "Predicting cell-cell interactions between source cell types and target\
    \ cell types."
  description: "The growing availability of single-cell data has sparked an increased\
    \ interest in the inference of cell-cell communication (CCC),\nwith an ever-growing\
    \ number of computational tools developed for this purpose.\n\nDifferent tools\
    \ propose distinct preprocessing steps with diverse scoring functions that are\
    \ challenging to compare and evaluate.\nFurthermore, each tool typically comes\
    \ with its own set of prior knowledge. To harmonize these,\nDimitrov et al recently\
    \ developed the [LIANA+](https://github.com/saezlab/liana-py) framework, which\
    \ was used as a foundation for this task.\n\nThe challenges in evaluating the\
    \ tools are further exacerbated by the lack of a gold standard to benchmark the\
    \ performance of CCC\nmethods. In an attempt to address this, Dimitrov et al use\
    \ alternative data modalities, including the spatial proximity of cell types\n\
    and downstream cytokine activities, to generate an inferred ground truth. However,\
    \ these modalities are only approximations of\nbiological reality and come with\
    \ their own assumptions and limitations. In time, the inclusion of more datasets\
    \ with known ground\ntruth interactions will become available, from which the\
    \ limitations and advantages of the different CCC methods will be better understood.\n\
    This subtask evaluates methods in their ability to predict interactions between\
    \ spatially-adjacent source cell types and target\ncell types. This subtask focuses\
    \ on the prediction of interactions from steady-state, or single-context, single-cell\
    \ data.\n"
